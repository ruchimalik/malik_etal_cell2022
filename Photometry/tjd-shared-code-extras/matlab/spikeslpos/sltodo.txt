TODO:
   -clnos/excludecls/? as dedicated helper fn
   -'tcthresh' make this an operation performed for each
    parmest/raster plot, on its tunecurves/clnos (**), according to
    some fn on the tcdats (part of plot? plot editor?)
   -'randperm'/'pfperm' (cf objtodo/parmest,raster)
   -refactor slkeypress
   -yzoom. test tc.tuneparam to see which ones to zoom? add ylim field
    to a.plots. Also passed in to mkraster/mkparmest?
   -datalims across contplots?
   -rename 'runspeed' argument to e.g. filtparamval? No, move this out
    of spikeslpos
   -slmkplots needs to accept args, template

BUGS:
   -where is resize on first drawing of slp coming from? (everything
    cached, no biggie)

NEW PLOTS:
   -ylevels for plots other than cont (posest, e.g. to show stopping
    pts)
   -horiz plot showing position for all of run, with window on current
    location. Slideable? (i.e. scroll bar?) let user specify maxts/mints?
   -vertical panel with trackmaps: show rat position/direction as
    triangle (real xy) draw values of selected segment (l) as colored
    track segment, so can see where the replay is relative to rat's
    position. trackmap f'n?. second window/monitor? update as cursor moves
   -text status bar: 
     - current cursor x, y, 
     - rat's position at that time x (nearest neighbor)
     - names/colors of seglists
     - name/time of current segment, view?
   -'play' current window as 2-D movie, call with fpfmap and rpfmap,
    binsize, contdata
      -select region with middle-drag, then hit M to play it
      -tie into 'current plot' selector
      -linear track movies, use l, ldir, offtrackd (this should be +/- for L/R)
      -4 tracks: F/R 2D, F/R 1D, so that fwd/reverse replay more obvious
      -rat as triangle
      -rat's current position (eventually use DVD frames; mplayermex?)

UI IDEAS:

   -'selected plot' (using up/down arrows?) 
     -for keypresses (show/hide position, movies, height, ylim).
     -can specify on commandline.
     -popup uipanel for each plot with controls.
   -'plotslist': scroll through different cell arrays of plots of same
    xlim (up/down arrows). plotslisti? (set up all plots at beginning
    (empty)then scroll up/down with animation)
   -control figure size (in pixels?) with arg. Useful for making
    figures, recreating plots using argstruct (see slprint ?)
   -bookmark: save current timewin to end of current viewlist/write
    out to base ws?
   -'warnings' cell array, with advisories (about, e.g. having to
    rescale timebin, randomization) that don't go to the console every
    time we redraw. 
   -'esc/F1' key toggles between last view (save last sla.plots in
    sld, or just timewin?, but not when just, e.g. showing/hiding
    position. More general undo/redo? NOooooo!
   -'h' for help message dialog box instead of title bar--use same
    text
   -'x' export keypress to export the slargs/sldata to the base
    workspace. (textbox for var name?)
   -mouse over rasters, find all cells w/ rasters/spikes under mouse,
    list by color -- ick? have mkraster output a vector of cells
    present at each data height.
     -make context menu per raster?: exclude, plot pf, plot clusters,
      launch xclust.

DOC:
 - spikeslpos:
   - distributes overarching args/defaults (e, runspeed) to user's plots

 - drawplot
    - has a big switch for plots.type, e.g.

      switch plots{k}.type
       case 'parmest'
	mkparmest (cached, so can be fast)
	drawparmest
       case 'raster
        ...
      end
      [sl-specific draw stuff, axes, lims, flip]
      [save tc, pe to cache]


PROGRAMMING:
 -Performance ideas:
   -??did switching to 'objs' struct in drawplot slow things down
    slightly? probably not.
   -redrawing stuff:
     -move cla/etc to drawparm, sometimes don't need to redraw or
      delete ('redraw' flag? on cache_hit). store old handles in
      sla.plots? or sld.plots corresponding to it.
     -when redrawing, just update image cdata, xdata, ydata, rather
      than cla/redraw.
     -no need to do complete redraw when turning on/off segments. Just
      use xor drawing mode and delete the handles.
     -'interp' shading is slow during mousezoom, turn it off while
      zooming ?
   -use some interruptible bg process (timer?) to calculate next views
    while waiting: right/left/zoom. AA says timers suck ass.
 -use subimage (or do same thing myself) to convert indexed images to
  RGB, rather than dealing with all the colormap crap
 -have slp 'tell' each plot its 'plotno', so that it can do things
  like, e.g. rotate default colororder for drawcont lines


RETOOL:
   -break out 'plots' editing from figure setup/drawing.
   -spikeslpos will just be a wrapper for drawplot
     -still needs to know about xstart/xend tstart/tend?
   -get rid of dependency on having an exp struct
   -multiple plots/axis
     -currently just handle special cases in drawplot. Need to draw
      things in correct order, interactions between ylim for
      raster/parmest with and w/o parm
   -handlegroups, uipanels, for subaxes. Can have own resize fns, etc...
