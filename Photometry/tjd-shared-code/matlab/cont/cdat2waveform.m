% cdat is a cont struct (as returned by Tom's imcont.m)
%
% -upthresh and downthresh are thresholds in same units as cdat (usually
% mV). If both are specified, we trigger on upward and downward crossings of
% the two values. 'postignore' is enforced across the union of the
% crossings. (E.g. if you trigger on a downward crossing, you have to wait
% 'postignore' samples before you can trigger on either an upward or a
% downward crossing.)
%
% -spikewin is number of waveform points to extract per spike (AD = 32)
%
% -prespikepts is number of points before the threshold crossing to include
% (AD = 6)
%
% -postignore is the number of points after a threshold crossing where we
% ignore other threshold crossings (AD = 26).
